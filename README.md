# Vardy-vs-Aguero-Shot-Map
This is my first project on Github - A look into the shot map of two prolific goal scorers Jamie Vardy and Sergio Aguero from the 2015-16 Premier League season. The 2015-16 was nothing short of extraordinary, with Leicester City FC clinching the title to everyone's surprise. A major reason for their success was Jamie Vardy scoring
24 goals, falling one short of the golden boot. However Manchester City's striker Sergio Aguero too had an outstanding season amassing 24 goals too.
Let's look at how different were these 2 prolific strikers from each other.
